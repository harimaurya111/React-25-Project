        This is the Contact Page where users can reach out to us. It demonstrates how lazy loading works with routes in React apps. When you navigate to this page, React loads it dynamically. This technique saves loading time on the initial visit. Our contact system is efficient, clean, and minimalisticâ€”thanks to Tailwind CSS. You can expand this page to include forms, contact details, maps, and more in your projects.
